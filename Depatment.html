            <br />
            <hr />
            After independence, there was the only college at Kolhapur i.e. The
            Rajaram College, (established in 1880), catering to the needs of
            higher education. Only the students from upper classes could reap
            the benefits of that facility. Consequently, students from weaker
            classes from Kagal were deprived of higher education, as there was
            no institution of higher learning in and around Kagal.

                    rief Description The Commerce Department has been operating
                    at the degree level since the establishment of the college.
                    Nevertheless, the college does not have post-graduate
                    education facilities for the students of Commerce Department
                    like M.Com, MBA and M.S.W. Our students had no choice but to
                    go to Kolhapur City for postgraduate courses like these. As
                    a result, there is a high rate of discontinuation of girls'
                    post-graduate education. In view of these matters, M.Com
                    classes have been started in college since June 2016.
